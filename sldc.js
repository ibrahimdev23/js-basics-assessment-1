// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & Integration
// 6. Maintain
//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development
     Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step in which we anaysis the requirements of the projects, what the costs are, resouces, ect"

const design = "This is the third step, in which the team figues out how to go about building the project. What tech stack will be used, how the user inferace will work, what the end user goal is."

const implementation = "This is the fourth strp in which the actual development begins. "

const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step in which the project is tested for any problems, and bugs. There is also testing to make sure the program runs as intended"

const maintain = "This is the sixth step that insures that the project will be kept up to date. If something breaks or a new feature is needed, this is the step where that is add."
